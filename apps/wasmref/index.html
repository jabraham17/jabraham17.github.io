    <p>
      In the course of some of my work, I have frequently needed a one-stop shop reference for WebAssembly instructions.
      However, I have been unable to find one that meets all my needs.
    </p>
    <p>My requirements for the information is that it must display the instruction name, the full hex code, the effect the instruction has on the stack, and whether it takes an immediate. I also wanted something that would be updated live (with little to no maintenance) and that included some of the top proposals (ie SIMD and Threading).</p>
