        Over the years I have developed numerous desktop and mobile applications, mostly for myself to use. Many of my projects are open source and can be viewed on <a href="https://www.github.com/jacob-abraham">my Github</a>. The repository for this website is also hosted <a href="https://www.github.com/jacob-abraham/jacob-abraham.github.io">here</a>. Unfortunately, not all of my projects are public.  Some of them are sold on the App Store, and others are kept private due to legal concerns. Most of these legal concerns pertain to school projects that for plagiarism reasons must be kept private, but where I can I make those public.
